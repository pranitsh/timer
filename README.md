# Timer Widgets

### Roadmap
A list of planned ideas that I'll update once I come across solutions or find the time to implement.

- Find way to also work on Watches, Phones, TVs, etc.
- Synchronize via WebRTC, barcodes, QR codes, and URL parameters.
- Shared database webworker for multiple tabs.
- Maybe more complex time management.
- Graphs.
- Choose tool to convert to (nextjs, TypeScript and Webpack, etc).
